# The Maxwell Simulation

This is a personal startup project made as a part of CS 260 with Professor Jensen.



## Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch

Hey, my life has been pretty crazy recently and I'm really sorry I've never got around to playing that chess game with you we always talked about. Now, I know you *think* you're better and all that, but I think I've found a way to resolve all that. I call it...The Maxwell Simulation! The MS (Maxwell Simulation) is hosted online, is easily accesible, and allows anyone to play me in chess. At anytime. The MS can even play multiple people at once. Think of the time saved! You'll even be able to see where you rank among everyone, and come back to play me whenever you want!

### Design

This is how the user is prompted to login, to save their time score (upon a win) to the leaderboard database.

This is what the displayed chess board looks like, with server notes about other players on the left, and comments made by 'me' on the bottom right.

This is how the network will manage the gamestate and interaction on the game page.

### Key Features

* Secure authentication with the server via HTTPS
* Ability to make illegal moves on the board in case you need to cheat
* Display of the chess board and individual pieces
* Ability to view all-time leaderboard of users that have beaten the 'MS' system along with their associated times
* Leaderboard results are permanently stored

### Technologies

* **HTML** - Structures the application as well as the chess board. Three HTML pages, the game page, the login page, and the leaderboard page.
* **CSS** - Makes the board look pretty, as well as formats the login box and leaderboard.
* **Javascript** - Updates the board without refreshing the page and enables login functionality.
* **Service** - Provides backend services for logging in and calculating a new board position.
* **MongoDB** - Stores leaderboard information and user login information.
* **Websocket** - As games finish, if the user has won they are added to the leaderboard database along with elapsed game time.
* **React** - Application ported to use the React framework.

## HTML Deliverable

For this deliverable I created the structure of my website using HTML.
* **Four Pages** - I created four separate html pages that represent a home page, a login page, a signin page, and the page you play chess on.
* **Text** - I have placed text or text placeholders where necessary for the implementation of live notifications (WebSocket) and my online persona speaking.
* **Links** - Each page has a link to each of the others for accesibility, all accessed through a navigation bar.
* **Image** - The image that represents myself is displayed on the play.html page.
* **Login** - Input boxes and an encapsulating form have been placed on the signin.html page so that users can log in.
* **WebSocket** - A text box has been placed in the play.html page that will be updated in real time with other player's results.
* **Database** - Leaderboards.html includes a table where the MongoDB leaderboard information will be placed.

## CSS Deliverable

For this deliverable I designed the appearance of my website using CSS and the Bootstrap framework.
* **General Structure** - Properly styled CSS header, footer, and main content body - *done* - Header and footer are adaptable to window size and effectively display links.
* **Navigation** - Properly styled CSS navigation elements - *done* - All navigation elements are organized and prominently displayed.
* **Resizing** - Responsive to window resizing - *done* - Site elements resize, especially play.html to adjust for the size of the chess board. Different screen sizes are accounted for with Bootstrap.
* **Application Elements** - Properly styled CSS application elements - *done* - The chess board uses css (and a lil JavaScript) to calculate the proper size for screen height and width. Bootstrap columns are effectively used for content display and adjustability.
* **Application Content** - Properly styled CSS application text content - *done* - The site uses a cool font and text is placed correctly for dialogue from 'me' and WebSocket notifications.
* **Application Images** - Properly styled CSS application images - *done* - Logo and the representation of me use CSS to regulate size and appearance, including a colorful border to view while playing.

## Javascript Deliverable

For this deliverable I enabled functionality of my website through design of my own chess API using stockfish and basic javascript
* **Login functionality** - Javascript support for future login - *done* - Login information is cached when the user desires it to be, and is displayed throughout the site.
* **Database functionality** - Javascript support for future database data - *done* - Adaptable javascript dynamically generates simulated database data. Successful game wins are 'added' to database.
* **WebSocket functionality** - Javascript support for future WebSocket - *done* - New text is generated every 2 seconds to simulate games being finished elsewhere and the user notified via WebSocket.
* **Basic Interaction Logic** - Javascript support for your application's interaction logic - *done* - Chess board uses javascript to make intelligent moves that are *not* random. It tracks board state and and endgame conditions. JSON interaction makes data about the gamestate possible from the API, including a game evaluation score that can be used in the future.

## Service Deliverable
**I spoke with Professor Jensen - I previously developed the API for the Javascript deliverable and made it available at apiproject.msimul.click/api/fish?fen=...**
* **Create an HTTP Service** - Create an HTTP service using Node.js and Express - *done* - My service is initialized correctly and is available at startup.msimul.click.
* **Frontend Service** - Frontend served up using Express static middleware - *done* - My frontend static files are served up correctly with ExpressJS.
* **Frontend Third-party Interaction** - My frontend calls a third-party service endpoint 'icanhazdadjoke.com' to have my simulation say a dad joke after each successful move.
* **Backend Service Endpoints** - My backend provides service endpoints - *done* - My backend provides the '/api/fish' endpoint to interact with the customized stockfish engine to play moves at 'my' level.
* **Frontend/Backend Interaction** - My frontend calls my service endpoints - *done* - My frontend properly interacts with my backend endpoint to play the received move from the engine.

## Login Deliverable
* **Registration** - Supports new user registration - *done* - New users can register their own username/password combination for future use and game tracking. Data is stored in MongoDB.
* **Authentication** - Supports existing user authentication - *done* - The signin functionality correctly identifies username/password combinations that are valid and authenticates the user.
* **MongoDB Storage** - Stores application data in MongoDB - *done* - Leaderboard scores are updated opon a win and are reflected on the global leaderboards page across all users using MongoDB.
* **Credentials** - Stores and retrieves credentials in MongoDB - *done* - User information is stored securely in MongoDB and is verified and retrieved upon signin.
* **Authenticated User** - Restricts application functionality based upon authentication - *done* - Access to the actual 'play' functionality redirects unauthorized users to the signin page.

## WebSocket Deliverable
* **Backend** - Backend listens for WebSocket connection - *done* - The server listens for connections to upgrade to websocket connections and creates them accordingly.
* **Frontend** - Frontend makes WebSocket connection - *done* - Client javascript establishes a WebSocket with the server and properly listens for messages.
* **Data Transfer** - Data sent over WebSocket connection - *done* - Information about lost and won games is sent by clients and relayed to all clients by the server.
* **Display** - WebSocket data displayed in the application interface - *done* - Incoming notifications regarding other users of the Maxwell Simulation are displayed in the notification box with icons.

## React Deliverable
* **Vite** - Bundled using Vite - *done* - The development and build processes both involved vite, and the live product has gone through the Vite toolchain.
* **React Components** - Multiple functional React components - *done* - Home, Signin, Play, and the Leaderboard components are all functional and work as intended.
* **React Router** - React router - *done* - BrowserRouter functionality is built in to the React ported application, and it navigates the pages correctly.
* **React Hooks** - React hooks - *done* - Hooks are used successfully to update the state of the leaderboard and enable general functionality.
